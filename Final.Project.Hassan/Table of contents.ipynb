There are three references provided in introduction file and among them the first one is highly recommonded for start . The second one includes some examples and also additional information and the third one contains some useful points how to make similarity between physical parameters between LBM and the equations we tend to solve . There are so many other references which might better than these three references and also might have useful information ."

Up to the code number \"8\" we are working on heat conduction with different examples and boundary conditions . The first two codes are related to one dimensional diffusion equation . The code number 3 deals with two dimensional equation and as we illustrated there could be considered two types for particle distribution in two dimensional problems called D2Q9 and D2Q5 . \n",
      "In code number \"5\" we try to make a platform for two dimensional equation with D2Q9 by exploring the known heat conduction problem in a cavity (as a benchmark example) . Also the module 4 related problems are discussed in the codes from \"6\" to \"8\" . All These codes are compared with Finite differences method (FDM) which we learned in our numerical class ."
